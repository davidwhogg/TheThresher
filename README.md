### [Luck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_imaging) isn't a factor when you're using **The Thresher**.

Check out [the docs](http://davidwhogg.github.com/TheThresher).

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshing):

> Threshing is the process of loosening the edible part of cereal grain (or
> other crop) from the scaly, inedible chaff that surrounds it. It is the
> step in grain preparation after harvesting and before winnowing, which
> separates the loosened chaff from the grain. Threshing does not remove the
> bran from the grain.
